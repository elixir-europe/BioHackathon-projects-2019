# Knowledge graph for scholarly publications in Bioschemas13

## Research area alignment

- - Plant Sciences
 - Interoperability
 - ELIXIR Deposition Databases : EVA 
 - Address the lack of existing standard or API to exchange plant genotyping data in a FAIR compliant way
 - Development of community standards supporting metadata validation (Elixir Validation IS)
 - FONDUE Plant Sciences Community-led Implementation Study of ELIXIR (lead by U. Scholz)
 - Continuation of the BRAPI and MIAPPE alignment that successfully emerged from the 2018 biohackathon (Plant Validation track) and will provide the first step of an improvement of the FAIRness of genotyping data.
